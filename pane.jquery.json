  "description": "A jQuery UI widget which allows you to present entry points (or windows) into your data that can be served up from a server action or from static HTML (similar to a portlet in portal technology). Backed by jQuery's AJAX libraries, each pane acts independently from other panes -- achieving a clear separation of concerns between user actions.",
